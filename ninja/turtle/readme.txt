Description (additional):   

This is a Ninja Turtle player model that includes all the
player animation.  I (henry yau) should have spent more time and care the
while doing the modelling and animation, but i was busy with a load of
work.  Dweezil is a busy guy to but managed to do a good job with the time
he had. This was my first compleated Q2 model, it should have been out
earlier but I put it on the back burner and waited for a couple weeks.

BUGS: 
If you can't use the TMNT model in Quake2, try deleting all the files in
players NOT ANY DIRECTORY THOUGH.

Animation looks sorta funky. Like the pads seem to detach once in a
while and this shell is sometimes warped.  This is because i didn't
changed the model a little bit and didn't change the bone limitation.  But
as for the shell, I negelcted to put a bone for the shell.

So please don't email me about this crap.  I didn't know about them until
i viewed them in meddle.  And besides, I don't care about it anymore.  Its
the sorriest model i made, I just wanted to get this out fast as a Q2
model. Plus, those damn Ninja Turtles act this stupid anyways.  Just look
at the run sequence, tell me that does not look freekin dorky.
And I know he's supposed to flip you off, but ya know somethin, a turtle
doesn't really do that often, so he waves his finger at you.

-----
You may include this model in your mod, but please contact me and include
this readme too.
If you make a skin, DISTRIBUTE IT.  But TELL ME, i wanna see it.

TMNT is a registed trademark, and I don't wanna get in trouble
